# Setup Guide

This guide covers ChatGPT and Coding Agents using DevSpace Verge with local projects.

## Requirements

- Node `>=22.19 <27`
- pnpm `11.25.0`
- Git
- Bash, including Git Bash or WSL on Windows
- a public HTTPS URL that forwards to the local DevSpace server, only when
  ChatGPT will connect

DevSpace Verge does not create the public tunnel for you. ChatGPT users can use
Cloudflare Tunnel, ngrok, Pinggy, Tailscale Funnel, or their own HTTPS reverse
proxy.

## Install And Configure

Verge is currently distributed from its GitHub repository rather than npm:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yuezhihuafou/devspace-verge.git
cd devspace-verge
corepack enable
corepack prepare pnpm@11.25.0 --activate
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm build
npm link
```

Then initialize it:

```bash
devspace init
```

The setup flow asks one question at a time.

First choose where you will use DevSpace: ChatGPT, Coding Agents, or both.
DevSpace uses that answer to skip setup that does not apply to you.

### Project roots

If you selected ChatGPT, choose the project folders it may open through
DevSpace. Keep this narrow.

Examples:

```text
~/personal,~/work
```

```text
/Users/alice/dev,/Users/alice/work
```

```text
C:\Users\alice\dev,C:\Users\alice\work
```

A Coding Agents-only setup skips this question. Direct `devspace agents`
commands use the current Git project, or the current directory outside a
repository, with the authority of your local shell. MCP workspace operations
remain limited to the roots configured for ChatGPT.

### Coding Agents

Setup detects supported Coding Agents and asks which ones DevSpace may use.
These choices are stored as provider objects under `subagents` in
`~/.devspace/config.jsonc`.

If you selected Coding Agents, install the Verge subagents skill from GitHub:

```bash
npx skills add yuezhihuafou/devspace-verge --skill subagents --global
```

The Skills CLI asks which installed Coding Agents should receive the skill.
The skill uses `devspace agents targets`, `run`, `continue`, `show`, and `ls`.
These commands do not require `devspace serve`.

This Coding Agent installation is separate from ChatGPT MCP usage. For MCP
workspaces with Subagents enabled, DevSpace manages its own copy at
`~/.devspace/skills/subagents/SKILL.md`; users do not install that copy
manually.

### Connect ChatGPT

Setup only asks for a public URL if you selected ChatGPT. Start your tunnel or
reverse proxy first and point it at:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:7676
```

For Tailscale Funnel, proxy the whole DevSpace server from the root path:

```bash
tailscale funnel --bg 7676
```

Do not mount Funnel only at `/mcp` with `--set-path=/mcp`. DevSpace also serves
OAuth discovery and authorization routes outside `/mcp`, and a path mount can
strip `/mcp` before the request reaches DevSpace.

Enter the public origin without `/mcp`:

```text
https://your-tunnel-host.example.com
```

Configure the MCP client with the full MCP endpoint:

```text
https://your-tunnel-host.example.com/mcp
```

Protocol compatibility is automatic. DevSpace serves MCP 2026-07-28 requests
directly and handles older 2025-era clients statelessly on the same endpoint;
there is no client-protocol setting to maintain.

A Coding Agents-only setup skips this section.

## Start The Server

Run:

```bash
devspace serve
```

If your tunnel URL changes, update the persisted value before starting:

```bash
devspace config set publicBaseUrl https://devspace.example.com
devspace serve
```

## Approve The Client

When ChatGPT, Claude, or another MCP client connects, DevSpace shows an Owner
password approval page. Enter the Owner password printed during setup.

The default config files are:

```text
~/.devspace/config.jsonc
~/.devspace/auth.json
```

Keep `auth.json` private.

## Check Your Setup

Run:

```bash
devspace doctor
```

The doctor command reports the resolved config, Node version, Node ABI, platform,
Git, Bash, public URL, allowed hosts, and SQLite native dependency status.

## Running From A Local Checkout

Local checkout development uses the pnpm version pinned in `package.json`:

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm dev:seed
pnpm dev
```

The source server uses an ignored checkout-local fork of your normal DevSpace
configuration and SQLite state. See [Development and Manual QA](development.md)
for worktree switching, ChatGPT testing, and database migration workflows.
